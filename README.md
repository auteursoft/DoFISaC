# facial-search
Utility for searching by face on OSX (And possibly other OS's)

**Works with python3.11 on OSX. As of this commit, did not work with higher versions**. 

## Installation
1. Configure python 3 virtual environment: `python3.11 -m venv .venv`
2. Source the virtual env: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install required libraries: 
    - Safe: `pip install opencv-python face_recognition tqdm` 
    - Precise `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Indexing: 
1. `python face-indexer.py "/Volumes/super_54/google/sean.goggins/Google Photos"` for example. 


## Docker Instructions: 
1. `docker build -t facial-search .` 
2. Run The Container: 
```docker 
    docker run --rm \
    -v /Users/sean/Pictures:/data \
    -v $(pwd):/app \
    facial-search
```

## Desktop App (Still working on it)
1. Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed.
2. From Terminal, run:
```bash
   chmod +x run_search.command
   ./run_search.command
```

This will open a file dialog to choose your query image and face index (face_index.pkl).

To turn this into a native app:
- Use Automator on macOS: create an "Application" that runs `run_search.command`.

## Web App (Alpha)
1. ðŸš¨ The [`web-app](./web-app/) directory contains a way to serve everything up on a web page. 
2. You will need to know a few things about nginx configuration to make this work on a public site. 
3. The webapp requires that you have already run the `face-indexer.py` program and are able to find it from where you run the web app. 

ðŸš¨ There are different `pip install` requirements for the web app, FYI.
